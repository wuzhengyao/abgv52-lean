# Lean 4 formalization: the Procesi lattice and stable rationality of Z_H(F, 9)

This repository contains a machine-checked Lean 4 development verifying the
logical chain of the arguments in the accompanying paper on the Procesi
lattice obstruction to stable rationality (Problem 5.2 of the
Auel--Brussel--Garibaldi--Vishne problem list), for the group
H = C_3 x C_3 and its generalizations H = C_p x C_p.

## Paper

The paper is included in this repository:

* `paper/ABGV-5.2-resolution.tex` — LaTeX source (version of 2026-10-07);
* `paper/ABGV-5.2-resolution.pdf` — a compiled PDF.

The PDF was compiled from the current TeX source (2026-10-07).

## Verification code

The two verification programs of the paper's Appendix A (Python and GAP
with HAP) and their recorded output are in `verification/`; see
`verification/README.md`.  They can be re-run with `verification/run.sh`.

## Verification status

* The development compiles with no `sorry`.
* Every declaration depends only on the three standard axioms
  `propext`, `Classical.choice` and `Quot.sound`.
* The Endo--Miyata--Voskresenskii criterion is used as an explicit named
  hypothesis, exactly as in the paper; it is not reproved.  It is
  formalized as the type-locked interfaces `EMHyp` (H-level) and
  `EMHypP` (p-general), each with a definitional-shape lock, a wiring
  theorem, and a non-vacuity probe (`EM_ABGV52.lean`).
* Saltman's Corollary 3.13 (retract rationality) is quoted as an explicit
  named hypothesis, not reproved.  It is formalized as the type-locked
  interface `SaltmanHyp` with a wiring theorem that fills the
  faithfulness input from the elementary proof of faithfulness, and with
  a non-vacuity probe (`Saltman_ABGV52.lean`).
* The geometric identification Z_H(F, p^2) ≅ F(M|_H)^H (Procesi, 1967)
  is used as a named hypothesis: the development formalizes the reduction
  to the regular restriction and the transport of invariants along that
  identification, but neither constructs the field Z_H(F, p^2) nor proves
  Procesi's theorem.  The interface `ProcesiHyp` carries a
  definitional-shape lock, and `Procesi_ABGV52.lean` supplies the
  named-hypothesis consumption theorem and a non-vacuity probe.  The
  formalization of the stable-rationality chain is therefore conditional
  on these named inputs.

## Highlights

* The cohomological computation H^2(H, M|_H) ≅ C_9 is reproduced inside
  the development, together with the discriminant pair it yields.
* M|_H is not a stably permutation lattice: the relevant exponent bound
  on H^2 of permutation lattices is proved by combining Shapiro's lemma
  with the short exact sequence 0 -> Z -> Q -> Q/Z -> 0 of trivial
  modules over the corresponding subgroup.
* Z_H(F, 9) is not stably rational, with the Endo--Miyata--Voskresenskii
  criterion as the only hypothesis.
* Base change to the rationals: M|_H ⊗_Z Q ≅ 8 · Q[H] ⊕ Q as
  Q[H]-modules; both the linear isomorphism and its equivariance are
  formalized, together with the dimension count dim_Q = 73.
* The p-general statements for H = C_p x C_p (odd p) are formalized with
  p as a parameter; the case p = 3 is the corresponding instance.
